# Mixins

## Higher-Order Components
If you used jsx, then don't use mixins, use higher-order components instead. Please reference [React - Higher-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html) and [React - Mixins Considered Harmful](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html).
